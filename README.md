# Map Tap Revenge API

Map Tap Revenge is currently an API for an app where the user will be asked to click the location of country on a map.

It is with Node.js and Express that integrates various APIs to provide a fun quiz about countries. Users can interact with the application to learn facts about different countries, view country flags, and test their knowledge. The application uses OpenAI's API to generate fun facts and calculate distances between countries, Supabase to manage country data, and other utility functions to enhance the user experience.
